An open challenge to restore biodiversity in the River Shannon using Satellite data and AI.

# 🌊 Echoes Beneath the Surface: Restoring Fish Life in the Shannon

## Background

Once teeming with salmon, trout, and eels, the **River Shannon** was a living corridor of biodiversity—a place where generations of anglers, farmers, and families found livelihood and joy.  
Today, those rhythms are fading.
Overfishing, pollution, habitat fragmentation, invasive species, and warming waters have drastically reduced native fish stocks. Barriers such as dams and weirs restrict migration routes, while nutrient loads and algal blooms deplete oxygen levels.
Reversing this decline requires a fusion of ecology, data science, and community insight to understand what is happening beneath the surface and co-create paths toward recovery.

## 🎯 The Challenge

**How can we use technology, data, and local knowledge to track, understand, and restore fish populations in the Shannon Basin?**
Your mission: uncover the unseen dynamics of aquatic life—from spawning patterns to habitat loss—and design tools or solutions that help ecosystems thrive again.

---

## 💡 What to Do
You might choose to:

- Map fish habitats and migration pathways using spatial or satellite data  
- Analyze temperature, flow, and oxygen correlations affecting spawning success  
- Develop AI models predicting fish abundance based on water-quality and hydrology data  
- Create citizen-science reporting tools for anglers, boaters, and students to log fish sightings  
- Visualize “**Shannon Life Networks**” showing biodiversity connections from headwaters to estuary  
- Design policy or educational frameworks for sustainable fishing and habitat protection

## 💚 Why It Matters
The story of the Shannon’s fish is the story of balance—between land and water, people and planet.  
Restoring these ancient migrations means healing the entire ecosystem.  
By merging data with empathy, satellites with stories, and science with community, we can ensure that future generations still see the river shimmer with life. 🐠✨
